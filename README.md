<h1 align="center"> Lab 1 </h1>
<p align="center"> Task 1 - Develop a code for monitoring time execution of matrix multiplication </p>

### Notice
1. This python code was developped with the help of a few websites for a Lab.
Those sites are mentioned in the code.

- _Function 1_, line 10, originates from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17760877/getting-safe-user-input-in-python
   It was slightly modified to be used in this code

2. Librairies used in this program :
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib

### Installation and use
Before launching this program make sure **Python 3.10** is downloaded, and you have installed the packages of the librairies mentioned above with pip.
`pip install name_of_a_package` be sure to replace `name_of_a_package` with one of the above packets.
Once it's done, use the IDE of your choice to execute the code, be sure to install any extensions or elements you may need to execute this Python code.

#### Use / licencing not set
Please feel free to use this program if you need it.
If you use it in any project, hand-in lab, etc, please credit the work done by others and what I did, as I do my best to give credit to the work of others that help me.

### Requirements
For the time being, you need a graphical interface to use this program.
The recommended/ideal OS and specs would be any device:
- running under Windows 10/11 32/64bits with 
- sufficient memory usage, around 4 to 8 GB, tested with 16GB (some already in use)
- a processor running on 2.30 GHz basis up to 4.50 GHz
- any hardware, as long as there is space available.
Please avoid entering big numbers for this program; 150 was the max tested with.
Your computer may be impacted if you voluntarily input a higher number.

The above specs are close to the ones for which the program was tested on

### What does this code do ?
This codes computes the execution time on a diagram for n iteration and until size n for each matrix.
It will ask for the number of iterations you want to go for.

Please avoid entering big numbers for this program; 150 was the max tested with.
The est. time of execution for 150 iterations is a min to 3 min.
Your computer may be impacted if you voluntarily input a higher number.
